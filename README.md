## Setup Flask Server Locally
   Make sure you have Python and pip installed before proceeding further.
   - Setup a virtual Environment, we have used pipenv for the same
   ```bash
   $ pip install pipenv
   $ pipenv install
   $ pipenv shell
   ```
   - Install all dependencies (within the virtual environment)
   ```bash
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   - To run the server 
   ```bash
   $ python app.py 
   ```
